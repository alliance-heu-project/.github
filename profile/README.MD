# Alliance - Horizon Europe 
**Alliance** is a three-years long project funded by the European Union flagship research and innovation programme Horizon Europe. The project consortium consists of 25 organisations leaders in food supply chains, public policy, industry-specific technological development, innovation management, academia and public administrations.

Alliance aims to provide a holistic framework that safeguards data integrity and veracity, enhances traceability and transparency and reinforces interoperability in EU quality-labelled food supply chains. It proposes systemic solutions that go beyond current practices in order to enhance traceability, ensure authenticity, preserve quality and eliminate fraud in food products.

It will use innovative methods and tools to detect adulteration on the spot, as well as consolidate international and European links, raise awareness and promote multi-actor cooperation and information-sharing.

It will also increase transparency in quality-labelled supply chains, of organic, PDO, PGI and GI food, through improved track-and-trace mechanisms. Finally, it will equip food actors, farmers, public authorities, and policy makers with meaningful insights through 7 diverse use cases.


Alliance is funded under the EU Horizon Europe programme.
